# What I do on each clean install of a computer

This repo contains a set of software, settings and configs I use when I install a new fresh computer.
Usually it's a Windows machine, but I have done some work on Linux. 

I'm not saying I am an expert, but since I was keeping track of what I usually do I might as well share it and maybe help someone or get usefull feedback.
